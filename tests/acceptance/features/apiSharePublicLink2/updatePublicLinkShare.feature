  Scenario Outline: Adding public upload to a shared folder as recipient is allowed with permissions using the old public API
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs_api_version>"
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/test"
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "/test" with user "Brian" with permissions "all"
    And user "Brian" has created a public link share with settings
      | path         | /test |
      | publicUpload | false |
    When user "Brian" updates the last share using the sharing API with
      | publicUpload | true |
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs_status_code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And uploading a file should work using the old public WebDAV API
    Examples:
      | ocs_api_version | ocs_status_code |
      | 1               | 100             |
